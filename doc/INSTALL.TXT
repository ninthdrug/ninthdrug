What you need:
 - linux server
 - java jdk version 1.6+
 - ant version 1.8
 - scala version 2.9.0+

Building:
 - Extract the tar ball.
 - Change to the ninthdrug/trunk directory.
 - Edit the build.xml file to fit your installation. At the minimum you may
   want to change the scala.home property to point to your scala installtion
   and install.dir to point to where you want to install ninthdrug. 
 - Invoke ant.
 - Invoke ant install.

Configuring:
   The installstion creates a file name .ninthdrug in your home directory.  This
file contains the absolute paths to configuration files.  Initially, it should contains the path to ${install.dir}/cong/ninthdrug.conf.  You may edit this file as desired.
